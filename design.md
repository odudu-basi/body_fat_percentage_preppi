# Design Principles

## Exact Colors to Use

For the orange, pull directly from the logo. The primary orange appears to be around `#E85D04` or `#F26419` (a vibrant, energetic orange).

### Light Theme

| Token | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Primary | `#E85D04` | Logo orange |
| Background | `#FAFAFA` or `#F5F5F5` | Off-white, easier on eyes than pure white |
| Surface/Cards | `#FFFFFF` | White |
| Text Primary | `#1A1A1A` | Near black |
| Text Secondary | `#666666` | Gray |

### Dark Theme

| Token | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Primary | `#F26419` | Slightly brighter orange for dark backgrounds |
| Background | `#121212` or `#0D0D0D` | Near black |
| Surface/Cards | `#1E1E1E` | Dark gray |

## Font Recommendations

For a gym/fitness app, you want something that feels strong and modern but still readable:

- **Inter** – Clean, highly legible, works great for data-heavy screens (showing percentages, stats). Free on Google Fonts.
- **Barlow or Barlow Semi Condensed** – Slightly more athletic feel, condensed versions work well for tight spaces. Also free.
- **Outfit** – Modern geometric sans-serif, friendly but still professional.
- **Archivo** – Strong, slightly industrial feel that pairs well with fitness apps.

### Recommended Pairing

- **Body text:** Inter
- **Headings/Stats:** Barlow Semi Condensed Bold

This combination gives you readability plus that punchy, athletic vibe.

## Component Style Ideas

### Cards (for meal plans, exercise lists)

- Rounded corners (12-16px radius to echo the logo's soft edges)
- Subtle shadow on light theme, slight elevation on dark
- Orange accent on the left edge or as a progress indicator

### Buttons

- **Primary:** Solid orange with white text, rounded (8-12px radius)
- **Secondary:** Orange outline on white/dark background
- Consider slightly rounded "pill" shapes for CTAs

### Progress/Stats Display

- Circular progress rings work great for body fat percentage
- Use the orange as the fill color against a gray track
- Large, bold numbers (Barlow works well here)

### Checklist Items

- Custom checkboxes with orange fill when checked
- Subtle animations on completion (satisfying for gym-goers who love checking things off)

### Image Upload Area

- Dashed border in a muted orange
- Clear iconography showing the torso/upper body zone
- Consider a semi-transparent overlay guide showing where to position

### Navigation

- Bottom tab bar with orange highlight on active tab
- Icons should be simple line-style, filled when active
